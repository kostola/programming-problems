Programming Problems
====================

This repository contains the solutions to some random programming problems that I found somewhere.

Each directory contains a README file that state the problem and explains how to run the solutions.

I obviously would encourage you to try solving the problem by yourself before looking at my code.

If you want to discuss the solutions or suggest new problems, write me at <kost@alecosta.net>.
